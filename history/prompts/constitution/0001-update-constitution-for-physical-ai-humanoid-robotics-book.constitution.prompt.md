# Update constitution for physical ai humanoid robotics book

## Context

User requested to update the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book project. The constitution needed to be customized with project-specific principles and governance guidelines.

## Analysis

The existing constitution template was already updated with specific principles for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book project. The constitution includes:

1. **Core Principles**:
   - Architecture-First Design
   - Simulation-to-Reality Pipeline
   - Test-Driven Learning (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
   - Cross-Platform Compatibility
   - No Toy Examples Policy
   - Capstone-Aligned Curriculum

2. **Technical Stack Requirements**:
   - ROS 2 (Humble/Iron), NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem, Docusaurus for publishing
   - GitHub Pages deployment with multi-language support

3. **Educational Workflow**:
   - Architecture-first explanations
   - Concept → Architecture → Simulation → Deployment sequence

## Implementation

The constitution was already properly updated with project-specific principles that align with the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book project goals. The principles emphasize:
- Architecture-first design approach
- Simulation-to-reality pipeline
- Test-driven learning methodology
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Production-ready implementations
- Capstone-aligned curriculum structure

## Outcome

The project constitution is properly configured with 6 core principles that guide the development of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book. The constitution emphasizes practical, architecture-first learning with clear pathways from simulation to real-world deployment.

## Evaluation

The constitution successfully defines governance principles for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book project with clear, testable guidelines that support the project's educational objectives.
