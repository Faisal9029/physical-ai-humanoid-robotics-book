# Introduction

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This comprehensive guide bridges the gap between digital intelligence and physical embodiment, providing a complete pathway from simulation to real-world deployment of humanoid robots.

## About This Book

This textbook follows the Concept → Architecture → Simulation → Deployment sequence, ensuring every abstraction maps to real hardware or simulation. We avoid toy examples and focus on production-ready implementations that prepare students for real-world challenges.
