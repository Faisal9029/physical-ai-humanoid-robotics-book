# Part V: Capstone - Autonomous Humanoid

This capstone section integrates all concepts learned in the previous parts to design and implement an autonomous humanoid robot system. Students will apply knowledge from ROS 2, digital twin technology, AI-robot brains, and vision-language-action systems to create a comprehensive solution.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this capstone, students will be able to:
- Integrate all subsystems into a cohesive humanoid robot architecture
- Design end-to-end autonomous behaviors
- Implement safety protocols and fail-safe mechanisms
- Validate the complete system in simulation and prepare for real-world deployment
