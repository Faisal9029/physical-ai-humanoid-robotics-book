# Data Model: Vision-Language-Action

**Feature**: Vision-Language-Action for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics
**Date**: 2025-12-18

## Core Entities

### VoiceCommand
- **Purpose**: Represents a voice command received by the system
- **Attributes**:
  - `id` (string): Unique identifier for the command
  - `audio_data` (bytes): Raw audio data or path to audio file
  - `transcription` (string): Transcribed text from speech
  - `confidence` (float): Confidence score of transcription (0.0-1.0)
  - `timestamp` (datetime): When the command was received
  - `source` (string): Audio source identifier

### ActionPlan
- **Purpose**: Represents a sequence of actions generated by the LLM planner
- **Attributes**:
  - `id` (string): Unique identifier for the plan
  - `commands` (list): Sequence of action commands
  - `context` (dict): Environmental and situational context
  - `constraints` (list): Safety and feasibility constraints
  - `status` (string): Current status (pending, executing, completed, failed)
  - `created_at` (datetime): When the plan was created

### RobotAction
- **Purpose**: Represents a single executable action for the robot
- **Attributes**:
  - `id` (string): Unique identifier for the action
  - `type` (string): Action type (navigation, manipulation, etc.)
  - `parameters` (dict): Action-specific parameters
  - `target` (string): Target object or location
  - `priority` (int): Execution priority level
  - `timeout` (float): Maximum time allowed for execution

### ExecutionResult
- **Purpose**: Represents the result of executing an action
- **Attributes**:
  - `action_id` (string): ID of the executed action
  - `status` (string): Execution status (success, failure, timeout)
  - `feedback` (dict): Execution feedback and metrics
  - `timestamp` (datetime): When the execution completed
  - `error_message` (string): Error details if execution failed

## Relationships

- `VoiceCommand` → `ActionPlan` (one-to-one): Each voice command generates one action plan
- `ActionPlan` → `RobotAction` (one-to-many): Each action plan contains multiple robot actions
- `RobotAction` → `ExecutionResult` (one-to-one): Each robot action produces one execution result
