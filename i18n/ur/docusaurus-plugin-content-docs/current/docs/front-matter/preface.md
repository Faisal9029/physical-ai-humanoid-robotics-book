# Preface

Welcome to "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics". This textbook bridges the gap between digital intelligence and physical embodiment, providing a comprehensive guide to designing, simulating, and deploying embodied AI systems using humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the fundamental concepts of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Learn how to connect digital intelligence (LLMs, VLA) with physical embodiment
- Master the simulation-to-reality deployment pipeline
- Apply theoretical concepts to real humanoid robotics applications

## Conceptual Explanation
This book follows the Concept → Architecture → Simulation → Deployment sequence, ensuring every abstraction maps to real hardware or simulation. We avoid toy examples and focus on production-ready implementations that prepare students for real-world challenges.

## Simulation Mapping
Throughout this book, we emphasize the connection between simulation environments (Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac Sim) and real-world applications. Each concept includes clear pathways from virtual to physical implementation.

## Hardware Mapping
All concepts are designed with real humanoid robotics hardware in mind, compatible with ROS 2 (Humble/Iron), NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem, and Jetson Orin platform.

## Assessment Alignment
Learning outcomes align with capstone execution, ensuring students can build comprehensive humanoid robot applications by the end of the course.
