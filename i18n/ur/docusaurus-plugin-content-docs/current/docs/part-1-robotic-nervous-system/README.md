# Part I: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This part establishes the foundational communication and description framework for humanoid robotics systems using ROS 2. It covers the essential components that enable distributed robotic applications to function as a cohesive "nervous system."

## Overview

The Robotic Nervous System encompasses all aspects of robot communication, coordination, and representation. This includes:

- **Communication Architecture**: How different robot subsystems communicate and coordinate
- **System Description**: How robots are modeled and represented in both simulation and reality
- **Programming Interfaces**: How to implement robotic software components
- **Integration Framework**: How all components work together in a unified system

## Learning Path

This part is structured to build understanding progressively:

1. **Introduction to ROS 2 Architecture**: Foundational concepts and system overview
2. **Nodes, Topics, and Services**: Core communication mechanisms
3. **rclpy Agents and Client Libraries**: Python-based robot software development
4. **URDF for Humanoid Robots**: Robot description and modeling

## Key Concepts

- Distributed computing model for robotics
- Publish-subscribe and request-response communication patterns
- Quality of Service (QoS) for real-time requirements
- Robot modeling and description
- Simulation-to-reality transfer principles
- Safety and reliability in robotic systems

## Practical Applications

Students will apply these concepts to design and implement:
- Communication architectures for multi-subsystem robots
- Python-based perception and control nodes
- Accurate robot models for simulation and control
- Integrated systems that work across simulation and real hardware
