# Hardware & Lab Architecture

This appendix provides detailed information about the physical AI lab setup and hardware requirements for implementing the concepts in this book.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand on-prem vs cloud lab architecture options
- Identify hardware requirements for humanoid robotics projects
- Configure lab infrastructure for optimal development and testing
- Analyze cost trade-offs for different hardware configurations

## Conceptual Explanation
Physical AI labs require specialized infrastructure to support the development, testing, and deployment of humanoid robotics systems. The architecture choice between on-premises and cloud solutions affects performance, cost, and development workflow.

Hardware requirements include computing resources for AI processing, networking for real-time communication, safety systems, and specialized equipment for humanoid robot testing. The architecture must support both simulation and real-robot development workflows.

## Simulation Mapping
Lab architecture for simulation-focused work requires:
- High-performance computing resources for physics simulation
- Network infrastructure supporting real-time communication
- Development workstations with appropriate GPUs for AI training
- Storage systems for large simulation datasets

## Hardware Mapping
Lab architecture for real hardware work requires:
- Physical safety systems and enclosures for robot testing
- High-bandwidth networking for real-time robot control
- Power systems for humanoid robot operation
- Specialized tools and equipment for robot maintenance
- Backup and redundancy systems for critical components

## Assessment Alignment
Students and educators will evaluate lab configurations by:
- Assessing the trade-offs between on-prem and cloud solutions
- Calculating cost-effectiveness for different use cases
- Identifying potential latency risks in real-time systems
- Planning infrastructure upgrades for future needs
