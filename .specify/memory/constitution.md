# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### Architecture-First Design
Every concept starts with a clear architectural diagram showing how digital intelligence connects to physical embodiment; All abstractions must map to real hardware or simulation; No theoretical concepts without practical implementation mapping

### Simulation-to-Reality Pipeline
Every implementation must follow the Concept → Architecture → Simulation → Deployment pipeline; All simulations must have clear pathways to real-world deployment; Each chapter must include both simulation mapping and real-world deployment notes

### Test-Driven Learning (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every learning outcome must be validated through practical exercises; Students must implement concepts in simulation before advancing; All code examples must be tested in both simulated and real environments where possible

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
All implementations must work across ROS 2 (Humble/Iron), Gazebo/Unity, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, and Jetson Orin platforms; Code examples must be portable and well-documented for different environments

### No Toy Examples Policy
Every example must connect to real hardware capabilities or realistic simulation; All learning materials must map to actual humanoid robot applications; Focus on production-ready implementations rather than simplified demos

### Capstone-Aligned Curriculum
All learning outcomes must align with capstone project execution; Chapters must build incrementally toward comprehensive humanoid robot applications; Each module contributes to a cohesive end-to-end system

## Technical Stack Requirements
Mandatory technologies include ROS 2 (Humble/Iron), NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem, Vision-Language-Action frameworks, and Docusaurus for publishing; All implementations must be compatible with Jetson Orin platform; GitHub Pages deployment with multi-language support (English/Urdu) and theme toggling required

## Educational Workflow
All chapters must include conceptual theory, system diagrams, simulation mapping, and real-world deployment notes; No code dumps allowed - architecture-first explanations required; Modular chapters aligned with course week schedules

## Governance
All content must follow the Concept → Architecture → Simulation → Deployment sequence; All examples must avoid toy implementations; Educational materials must align with target audience of senior students and professional engineers
